# Movie Trailer Website
Source code for a Movie Trailer website from Udacity full stack web dev nanodegree.

## Getting Started
To generate the webpage, run `entertainment_center.py`. An HTML file named `fresh_tomatoes.html` will be created in the active directory and opened in the default browser.

## Customization

Movies can be entered in the `entertainment_center.py` file as instances of the `Movie` class.

Each instance of the class must have three attributes:
* `title`: Title of the Movie
* `poster_image_url`: URL of the movie's poster
* `trailer_youtube_url`: Youtube URL of the movie's trailer.

## Background
 `media.py`  creates the class `movie`.

`fresh_tomatoes.py` generates the HTML for the website.
